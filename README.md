# AlphaPersistenceLength


AlphaPersistenceLength is a program written in Python 3 to calculate the persistence length along the axis of an alpha helix.
To use it, follow these steps:
  - Move the .pdb file of your alpha helix into your working directory
  - At the top of the program, assign the name of your pdb file to the variable "YOUR_PDB_FILE_HERE"
  - At the top of the last cell, on the third line, change the middle value in ````range(1,CHANGETHISONE,4)```` to (#total residues - 4).
  - Run all the cells
  - The magic happens relatively fast
  - **Your calculated persistence length appears at the bottom**


## Tech

AlphaPersistenceLength uses a couple of free and open source projects to work properly:

* [NumPy] - Numerical, scientific computing with Python
* [Juypter] - Numerical, scientific computing with Python
